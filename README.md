# dog-breed-classification
Identify the breed of a dog from its picture

Dataset Description
We provided with a training set and a test set of images of dogs. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs. The goal is to create a classifier capable of determining a dog's breed from a photo.

File descriptions :-
train.zip - the training set, you are provided the breed for these dogs; 
test.zip - the test set, you must predict the probability of each breed for each image; 
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format; 
labels.csv - the breeds for the images in the train set

This repository contains code for a machine learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs into their respective breeds. The model is trained on the Dog Breed Identification dataset from Kaggle, which includes 120 different breeds.
